`rtop-vis` can monitor load and memory usage of all the specified servers
and visualize the data as a graph with a bit (10 minutes' worth) of history.
It connects to servers via SSH and does not need anything to be installed
on the servers. The collected data is not persisted. It is lost when `rtop-vis` is stopped.

`rtop-vis` is MIT-licensed and can be used anywhere with attribution.

*`rtop-vis`'s [home page](http://www.rtop-monitor.org/rtop-vis) has more
information and screenshots!*
